This is an experiment. I'm trying to re-record [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEu3t-KJVVg) using [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/).

The original code comes from [pomber/the-x-in-mdx](https://github.com/pomber/the-x-in-mdx), I applied a [series of hacks](https://twitter.com/pomber/status/1358893411894452228) until it worked with Remotion. Please don't reuse this code, it's just a proof of concept.

## Commands

**Start Preview**

```console
npm start
```

**Render video**

```console
npm run build
```
